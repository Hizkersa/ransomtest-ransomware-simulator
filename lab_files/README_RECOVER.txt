=== RANSOMTEST EDUCATIONAL NOTE ===

Your files in this sandbox have been SIMULATED as 'encrypted' by the ransomtest educational ransomware simulator.

No real harm has been done:
- Original files remain untouched in this lab_files/ directory.
- Transformed copies are stored separately in encrypted_files/.

This tool is strictly for learning DFIR and blue-team analysis.
Do NOT run it outside controlled lab environments.
